This is a project which has a goal of creating an accurate and effective sentence classifier. This AI determines whether the sentence might contain spoilers or not.

## Main methods:
* Sentence classification
* Data preprocessing and hand-crafted features
* ~~Elements of sentiment analysis~~ - rejected after Exploratory Data Analysis and application of this method to the explored data
* Deep Learning Neural Networks (keras with tensorflow BE)

### Embeddings were provided by Stanford University: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
